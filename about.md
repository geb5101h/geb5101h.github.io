# About page

My name is Eric Janofsky. I am an industry data scientist who focuses on building data-driven products and systems for machine intelligence and decision-making. Currently I work at Uber in New York City supporting dispatch logistics and marketplace optimization on the Uber Everything team. I was a student at the University of Chicago, where I studied statistical machine learning and got a Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fgalton.uchicago.edu%2F&t=MDAxNjZkNjgzMThlMmY0ZTE3YzU5YzM2ZmI4YzZkMDU2ZWVmY2RhOCxUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D&p=&m=0). Iâ€™ve worked with a variety of tools and technologies (R, Python, Scala, Apache Spark).

I use this blog as a way to keep notes on various data science related things I come across, or novel ideas I've come up with. 

I also like baseball, books, cooking and cats.
