# About page

My name is Eric Janofsky. I am an industry data scientist who focuses on building data-driven products and systems for machine intelligence and decision-making. Currently I work at Uber in New York City. I was a student at the University of Chicago, where I studied statistical machine learning and got a Ph.D. from the <a href="http://www.stat.uchicago.edu">Department of Statistics</a>. I'll be a Visiting Assistant Professor at <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/mathematics-and-statistics">Haverford College</a> during the 2020-2021 school year.

I use this blog as a way to keep notes on various things, particularly concepts that are obscure or under-appreciated or novel ideas I've thought up.
